# Pizza Sales Analysis

## 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 :
This project is about Pizza sales analysis . The project started with importing data into Power BI and then performing a data cleaning/transformation process. With proper data modeling and DAX measures, an interactive report was created. Furthermore, enhancement on the report was done for a better UI experience. Then, the report was published into the workspace while ensuring access and the Row Level Security. Moreover, scheduled refreshing on the dataset was installed and a dashboard was designed.

# 𝐌𝐲 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬: 

1.The pizza company has, on average, 60 orders per day.

2.The usual peak hours are between 12 and 13 and 17 and 18. So the first recommendation is to launch ad campaigns 30 before peak hours.

3.Usually, customers order 1 or 2 pizzas in an order. So I recommend offering discounts for the pizza pairs.

3.The most popular size of ordered pizzas is L.

4.The analysis shows that there are more orders in warm months, starting from March until September, with the peak in July.

5.I recommend reviewing the profitability of the worst-selling pizzas and removing them from the menu.

6.Ordering The Thai Chicken, The Four Cheese, The Five Cheese, The Classic Deluxe or The Spicy Italian pizzas in L size, customers are likely to order another pizza in S size. I recommend giving an offer for The Big Meat Pizza in S size, as it is at the top of the pizzas most often sold together with size L pizzas.
